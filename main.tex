\begin{abstract}
    \note{Rough sketch:} 
    We can learn SED's directly from photometric data, without any a priori knowledge of galaxy spectra. 
    This is done by starting with naive templates, matching photometry to these templates, then applying a iterative learning algorithm. 
    This algorithm can also be used to calibrate a set of standard templates to a data set. 
    We apply this method to a data set that I need to describe. 
    The learned SED's have a similar fraction of outliers compared to CWW+SB4, but have lower bias and scatter. 
    The best results come from training the CWW+SB4 templates themselves. 
    Add a link to the Github repo that contains all of the code.
    \note{Need to really write this.}

This research is based on observations made with ESO Telescopes at the La Silla or Paranal Observatories under programme ID(s) 175.A-0839(B), 175.A-0839(D), 175.A-0839(I), 175.A-0839(J), 175.A-0839(H), 175.A-0839(F).
This research is also based on observations obtained with MegaPrime/MegaCam, a joint project of CFHT and CEA/DAPNIA, at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) which is operated by the National Research Council (NRC) of Canada, the Institut National des Science de l'Univers of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) of France, and the University of Hawaii.
This research is also based in part on data products produced at Terapix available at the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre as part of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey, a collaborative project of NRC and CNRS.
We use data from the VIMOS VLT Deep Survey, obtained from the VVDS database operated by Cesam, Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Marseille, France
We also use data from the VIMOS Public Extragalactic Redshift Survey (VIPERS).
VIPERS has been performed using the ESO Very Large Telescope, under the "Large Programme" 182.A-0886.

This research has also made use of the SVO Filter Profile Service (\url{http://svo2.cab.inta-csic.es/theory/fps/}) supported from the Spanish MINECO through grant AYA2017-84089.
