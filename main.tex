\begin{abstract}
    Estimating redshifts from broadband photometry is often limited by how accurately we can map the colors of galaxies to an underlying spectral template. 
    Current techniques utilize  spectrophotometric samples of galaxies or spectra derived from spectral synthesis models. 
    Both of these approaches have their limitations, either the sample sizes are small and often not representative of the diversity of galaxy colors or the model colors can be biased (often as a function of wavelength) which introduces systematics in the derived redshifts. 
    In this paper we learn the underlying spectral energy distributions from an ensemble of  $\sim$100K galaxies with measured redshifts and colors. 
    We show that we are able to reconstruct emission and absorption lines at a significantly higher resolution than the broadband filters used to measure the photometry for a sample of 20 spectral templates. 
    We find that our training algorithm reduces the fraction of outliers in the derived photometric redshifts by up to 28\%, bias up to 91\%, and scatter up to 25\%, when compared to estimates using a standard set of spectral templates. 
    We discuss the current limitations of this approach and its applicability for recovering the underlying properties of galaxies.
    Our derived templates and the code used to produce these results are publicly available in a dedicated Github repository: \url{https://github.com/dirac-institute/photoz_template_learning}.

This research is based on observations made with ESO Telescopes at the La Silla or Paranal Observatories under programme ID(s) 175.A-0839(B), 175.A-0839(D), 175.A-0839(I), 175.A-0839(J), 175.A-0839(H), 175.A-0839(F).
This research is also based on observations obtained with MegaPrime/MegaCam, a joint project of CFHT and CEA/DAPNIA, at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) which is operated by the National Research Council (NRC) of Canada, the Institut National des Science de l'Univers of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) of France, and the University of Hawaii.
This research is also based in part on data products produced at Terapix available at the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre as part of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey, a collaborative project of NRC and CNRS.
We use data from the VIMOS VLT Deep Survey, obtained from the VVDS database operated by Cesam, Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Marseille, France
We also use data from the VIMOS Public Extragalactic Redshift Survey (VIPERS).
VIPERS has been performed using the ESO Very Large Telescope, under the "Large Programme" 182.A-0886.
