abstract = {The evolution of galaxy clustering from z = 0 to z ≃ 4.5 is analysed using the angular correlation function and the photometric redshift distribution of galaxies brighter than IAB ≤ 28.5 in the Hubble Deep Field North. The reliability of the photometric redshift estimates is discussed on the basis of the available spectroscopic redshifts, comparing different codes and investigating the effects of photometric errors. The redshift bins in which the clustering properties are measured are then optimized to take into account the uncertainties of the photometric redshifts. The results show that the comoving correlation length r0 has a small decrease in the range 0 ≲ z ≲ 1 followed by an increase at higher z. We compare these results with the theoretical predictions of a variety of cosmological models belonging to the general class of Cold Dark Matter scenarios, including Einstein-de Sitter models, an open model and a flat model with non-zero cosmological constant. Comparison with the expected mass clustering evolution indicates that the observed high-redshift galaxies are biased tracers of the dark matter with an effective bias b strongly increasing with redshift. Assuming an Einstein-de Sitter universe, we obtain b ≃ 2.5 at z ≃ 2 and b ≃ 5 at z ≃ 4. These results support theoretical scenarios of biased galaxy formation in which the galaxies observed at high redshift are preferentially located in more massive haloes. Moreover, they suggest that the usual parameterization of the clustering evolution as $\xi$(r, z) = $\xi$(r, 0)(1 + z)-(3+∈) is not a good description for any value of ∈. Comparison of the clustering amplitudes that we measured at z ≃ 3 with those reported by Adelberger et al. and Giavalisco et al., based on a different selection, suggests that the clustering depends on the abundance of the objects: more abundant objects are less clustered, as expected in the paradigm of hierarchical galaxy formation. The strong clustering and high bias measured at z ≃ 3 are consistent with the expected density of massive haloes predicted in the frame of the various cosmologies considered here. At z ≃ 4, the strong clustering observed in the Hubble Deep Field requires a significant fraction of massive haloes to be already formed by that epoch. This feature could be a discriminant test for the cosmological parameters if confirmed by future observations.},

abstract = {We present a new model for computing the spectral evolution of stellar populations at ages between 1 × 105 and 2 × 10 10 yr at a resolution of 3 {\AA} across the whole wavelength range from 3200 to 9500 {\AA} for a wide range of metallicities. These predictions are based on a newly available library of observed stellar spectra. We also compute the spectral evolution across a larger wavelength range, from 91 {\AA} to 160 $\mu$m, at lower resolution. The model incorporates recent progress in stellar evolution theory and an observationally motivated prescription for thermally pulsing stars on the asymptotic giant branch. The latter is supported by observations of surface brightness fluctuations in nearby stellar populations. We show that this model reproduces well the observed optical and near-infrared colour-magnitude diagrams of Galactic star clusters of various ages and metallicities. Stochastic fluctuations in the numbers of stars in different evolutionary phases can account for the full range of observed integrated colours of star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds. The model reproduces in detail typical galaxy spectra from the Early Data Release (EDR) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We exemplify how this type of spectral fit can constrain physical parameters such as the star formation history, metallicity and dust content of galaxies. Our model is the first to enable accurate studies of absorption-line strengths in galaxies containing stars over the full range of ages. Using the highest-quality spectra of the SDSS EDR, we show that this model can reproduce simultaneously the observed strengths of those Lick indices that do not depend strongly on element abundance ratios. The interpretation of such indices with our model should be particularly useful for constraining the star formation histories and metallicities of galaxies.},

abstract = {We present the full public data release (PDR-2) of the VIMOS Public Extragalactic Redshift Survey (VIPERS), performed at the ESO VLT. We release redshifts, spectra, CFHTLS magnitudes and ancillary information (as masks and weights) for a complete sample of 86 775 galaxies (plus 4732 other objects, including stars and serendipitous galaxies); we also include their full photometrically-selected parent catalogue. The sample is magnitude limited to iAB ≤22.5, with an additional colour-colour pre-selection devised as to exclude galaxies at z {\textless} 0:5. This practically doubles the effective sampling of the VIMOS spectrograph over the range 0:5 {\textless} z {\textless} 1:2 (reaching 47{\%} on average), yielding a final median local galaxy density close to 5 × 10-3 h-3 Mpc-3. The total area spanned by the final data set is '23:5 deg2, corresponding to 288 VIMOS fields with marginal overlaps, split over two regions within the CFHTLSWide W1 and W4 equatorial fields (at RA ≃ 2 and ≃ 22 h, respectively). Spectra were observed at a resolution R = 220, covering a wavelength range 55009500 {\AA}. Data reduction and redshift measurements were performed through a fully automated pipeline; all redshift determinations were then visually validated and assigned a quality flag. Measurements with a quality flag ≥2 are shown to have a confidence level of 96{\%} or larger and make up 88{\%} of all measured galaxy redshifts (76 552 out of 86 775), constituting the VIPERS prime catalogue for statistical investigations. For this sample the rms redshift error, estimated using repeated measurements of about 3000 galaxies, is found to be $\sigma$z = 0:00054(1 + z). All data are available at http://vipers.inaf.it and on the ESO Archive.},

abstract = {We give an overview of the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX), a NASA Explorer Mission launched on 2003 April 28. GALEX is performing the first space UV sky survey, including imaging and grism surveys in two bands (1350-1750 and 1750-2750 A). The surveys include an all-sky imaging survey (mAB ≃ 20.5), a medium imaging survey of 1000 deg2 (mAB ≃ 23), a deep imaging survey of 100 deg2 (mAB ≃ 25), and a nearby galaxy survey. Spectroscopic (slitless) grism surveys (R = 100-200) are underway with various depths and sky coverage. Many targets overlap existing or planned surveys in other bands. We will use the measured UV properties of local galaxies, along with corollary observations, to calibrate the relationship of the UV and global star formation rate in local galaxies. We will apply this calibration to distant galaxies discovered in the deep imaging and spectroscopic surveys to map the history of star formation in the universe over the redshift range 0 {\textless} z {\textless} 2 and probe the physical drivers of star formation in galaxies. The GALEX mission includes a guest investigator program, supporting the wide variety of programs made possible by the first UV sky survey.},

The data acquisition and calibration has been a major undertaking for the Canadian and French communities: more than 2300 hours over 5 years (an equivalent of 450 nights) have been devoted to the survey using the wide field optical imaging camera MegaCam, a 1°x1° field of view 340 Megapixel camera.

abstract = {High-resolution spectra are necessary to distinguish and correctly measure the Balmer emission lines due to the presence of strong metal and Balmer absorption features in the stellar continuum. This accurate measurement is necessary for use in emission-line diagnostics, such as the Balmer decrement (i.e. H$\alpha$/H$\beta$), used to determine the attenuation of galaxies. Yet at high redshifts, obtaining such spectra becomes costly. Balmer emission-line equivalent widths are much easier to measure, requiring only low-resolution spectra or even simple narrow-band filters and therefore shorter observation times. However, a correction for the stellar continuum is still needed for this equivalent width Balmer decrement. We present here a statistical analysis of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7 (DR7) emission-line galaxy sample, using the spectrally determined Balmer emission-line fluxes and equivalent widths. Using the large numbers of galaxies available in the SDSS catalogue, we determined an equivalent width Balmer decrement including a statistically based correction for the stellar continuum. Based on this formula, the attenuation of galaxies can now be obtained from low spectral resolution observations. In addition, this investigation also revealed an error in the H$\beta$ line fluxes, within the SDSS DR7 MPA/JHU catalogue, with the equivalent widths underestimated by average ∼0.35{\AA} in the emission-line galaxy sample. This error means that Balmer decrement determined attenuations are overestimated by a systematic 0.1mag in AV, and future analyses of this sample need to include this correction. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society {\textcopyright} 2011 RAS.},

abstract = {In this paper we present and characterize a nearest-neighbors color-matching photometric redshift estimator that features a direct relationship between the precision and accuracy of the input magnitudes and the output photometric redshifts. This aspect makes our estimator an ideal tool for evaluating the impact of changes to LSST survey parameters that affect the measurement errors of the photometry, which is the main motivation of our work (i.e., it is not intended to provide the "best" photometric redshifts for LSST data). We show how the photometric redshifts will improve with time over the 10-year LSST survey and confirm that the nominal distribution of visits per filter provides the most accurate photo-{\$}z{\$} results. The LSST survey strategy naturally produces observations over a range of airmass, which offers the opportunity of using an SED- and {\$}z{\$}-dependent atmospheric affect on the observed photometry as a color-independent redshift indicator. We show that measuring this airmass effect and including it as a prior has the potential to improve the photometric redshifts and can ameliorate extreme outliers, but that it will only be adequately measured for the brightest galaxies, which limits its overall impact on LSST photometric redshifts. We furthermore demonstrate how this airmass effect can induce a bias in the photo-{\$}z{\$} results, and caution against survey strategies that prioritize high-airmass observations for the purpose of improving this prior. Ultimately, we intend for this work to serve as a guide for the expectations and preparations of the LSST science community with regards to the minimum quality of photo-{\$}z{\$} as the survey progresses.},

abstract = {We present aperture-matched PSF-corrected BVi'z'JH photometry and Bayesian photometric redshifts (BPZ) for objects detected in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (UDF), 8,042 of which are detected at the 10-sigma level (e.g., i'{\textless}29.01 or z'{\textless}28.43). Most of our objects are defined identically to those in the public STScI catalogs, enabling straightforward object-by-object comparison. We have combined detections from i', z', J+H, and B+V+i'+z' images into a single comprehensive segmentation map. Using a new program called SExSeg we are able to force this segmentation map into SExtractor for photometric analysis. The resulting photometry is corrected for the wider NIC3 PSFs using our ColorPro software. We also correct for the ACS z'-band PSF halo. The NIC3 magnitudes are found to be too faint relative to the ACS fluxes. Based on BPZ SED fits to objects of know spectroscopic redshift, we derived corrections of -0.30 +/- 0.03 mag in J and -0.18 +/- 0.04 mag in H. The offsets appear to be supported by a recent recalibration of the UDF NIC3 images combined with non-linearity measured in NICMOS itself. The UDF reveals a large population of faint blue galaxies (presumably young starbursts), bluer than those observed in the original Hubble Deep Fields (HDF). To accommodate these galaxies, we have added two new starburst templates to the SED library used in previous BPZ papers. The resulting photometric redshifts are accurate to within 0.04 * 1+z{\_}spec out to z {\textless} 6. Finally, we measure galaxy morphology, including Sersic index and asymmetry.

abstract = {A survey that can cover the sky in optical bands over wide fields to faint magnitudes with a fast cadence will enable many of the exciting science opportunities of the next decade. The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will have an effective aperture of 6.7 meters and an imaging camera with field of view of 9.6 deg{\^{}}2, and will be devoted to a ten-year imaging survey over 20,000 deg{\^{}}2 south of +15 deg. Each pointing will be imaged 2000 times with fifteen second exposures in six broad bands from 0.35 to 1.1 microns, to a total point-source depth of r{\~{}}27.5. The LSST Science Book describes the basic parameters of the LSST hardware, software, and observing plans. The book discusses educational and outreach opportunities, then goes on to describe a broad range of science that LSST will revolutionize: mapping the inner and outer Solar System, stellar populations in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies, the structure of the Milky Way disk and halo and other objects in the Local Volume, transient and variable objects both at low and high redshift, and the properties of normal and active galaxies at low and high redshift. It then turns to far-field cosmological topics, exploring properties of supernovae to z{\~{}}1, strong and weak lensing, the large-scale distribution of galaxies and baryon oscillations, and how these different probes may be combined to constrain cosmological models and the physics of dark energy.},

abstract = {Template UV-optical spectra of quiescent and starburst galaxies are presented and used to derive K-corrections as a function of morphological type and redshift. IUE observations and archival data are used for the UV template spectra. The optical spectra are from ground-based observations obtained in apertures that match closely the 200 arcsec{\^{}}2{\^{}} IUE aperture. The templates of quiescent galaxies are built according to morphological type, elliptical, bulge, S0, Sa, Sb, and Sc, and the templates of starburst galaxies according to color excess. The unprecedented characteristics of these templates is that UV and optical spectra have been obtained in matched apertures to produce consistent spectral information from 1200 to 10,000 A, Despite the relatively small IUE aperture, the galaxy stellar populations are well represented in the elliptical, S0, Sa, and Sc, and in the starburst templates. The spectra are available digitally. The UV-optical templates can be applied to the classification of high- redshift galaxies and to the identification of the host galaxies of quasars. The templates predict that observed magnitudes from traditional ground-based photometric surveys can be uniquely interpreted. For example, U, B, and I magnitudes uniquely determine both the redshift and the morphological type of a galaxy. The template spectra are also used to calculate K-corrections for galaxies as a function of morphological type and redshift, up to z = 2. These improved K-corrections are not sufficient to explain the excess counts in faint blue galaxies. A subset of our galaxy templates are linked with published data from the radio to the X-ray for galaxies and quasars. A comparison between the quiescent galaxies and the quasars suggests that, in the optical band, the host galaxy is a factor of 10-100 fainter in flux than the quasar.},

abstract = {We present a novel approach to photometric redshifts, one that merges the advantages of both the template-Ðtting and empirical-Ðtting algorithms without any of their disadvantages. This technique derives a set of templates describing the spectral energy distributions of galaxies from a catalog with both multicolor photometry and spectroscopic redshifts. The algorithm is essentially using the shapes of the templates as the Ðtting parameters. From simulated multicolor data we show that for a small training set of galaxies we can reconstruct robustly the underlying spectral energy distributions even in the presence of substantial errors in the photometric observations. We apply these techniques to the multi-color and spectroscopic observations of the Hubble Deep Field, building a set of template spectra that reproduced the observed galaxy colors to better than 10{\%}. Finally, we demonstrate that these improved spectral energy distributions lead to a photometric redshift relation for the Hubble Deep Field that is more accurate than standard template-based approaches.},

abstract = {Photometric redshift estimation is becoming an increasingly important technique, although the currently existing methods present several shortcomings which hinder their application. Here it is shown that most of those drawbacks are efficiently eliminated when Bayesian probability is consistently applied to this problem. The use of prior probabilities and Bayesian marginalization allows the inclusion of valuable information, e.g. the redshift distributions or the galaxy type mix, which is often ignored by other methods. In those cases when the a priori information is insufficient, it is shown how to `calibrate' the prior distributions, using even the data under consideration. There is an excellent agreement between the 108 HDF spectroscopic redshifts and the predictions of the method, with a rms error Delta z/(1+z{\_}spec) = 0.08 up to z{\textless}6 and no systematic biases nor outliers. The reliability of the method is further tested by restricting the color information to the UBVI filters. The results thus obtained are shown to be more reliable than those of standard techniques even when the latter include near-IR colors. The Bayesian formalism developed here can be generalized to deal with a wide range of problems which make use of photometric redshifts. Several applications are outlined, e.g. the estimation of individual galaxy characteristics as the metallicity, dust content, etc., or the study of galaxy evolution and the cosmological parameters from large multicolor surveys. Finally, using Bayesian probability it is possible to develop an integrated statistical method for cluster mass reconstruction which simultaneously considers the information provided by gravitational lensing and photometric redshifts.},

These include a statistically complete subset of 10,109 objects. The average accuracy of individual redshifts is 110 km s -1, independent of redshift. The reliability of individual redshifts is described by a Confidence Class that has been empirically calibrated through repeat spectroscopic observations of over 600 galaxies. There is very good agreement between spectroscopic and photometric redshifts for the most secure Confidence Classes. For the less secure Confidence Classes, there is a good correspondence between the fraction of objects with a consistent photometric redshift and the spectroscopic repeatability, suggesting that the photometric redshifts can be used to indicate which of the less secure spectroscopic redshifts are likely right and which are probably wrong, and to give an indication of the nature of objects for which we failed to determine a redshift. Using this approach, we can construct a spectroscopic sample that is 99{\%} reliable and which is 88{\%} complete in the sample as a whole, and 95{\%} complete in the redshift range 0.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.8.

abstract = {Refraction by the atmosphere causes the positions of sources to depend on the airmass through which an observation was taken. This shift is dependent on the underlying spectral energy of the source and the filter or bandpass through which it is observed. Wavelength-dependent refraction within a single passband is often referred to as differential chromatic refraction (DCR). With a new generation of astronomical surveys undertaking repeated observations of the same part of the sky over a range of different airmasses and parallactic angles, DCR should be a detectable and measurable astrometric signal. In this paper we introduce a novel procedure that takes this astrometric signal and uses it to infer the underlying spectral energy distribution of a source; we solve for multiple latent images at specific wavelengths via a generalized deconvolution procedure built on robust statistics. We demonstrate the utility of such an approach for estimating a partially deconvolved image, at higher spectral resolution than the input images, for surveys such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.},

In the IR, these exposure times yield a continuum signal-to-noise ratio of 5per resolution element at H 140 ∼ 23.1 and a 5$\sigma$ emission-line sensitivity of ∼5 × 10 -17 erg s -1 cm -2 for typical objects, improving by a factor of ∼2 for compact sources in images with low sky background levels. The WFC3/G141 spectra provide continuous wavelength coverage from 1.1 to 1.6 $\mu$m at a spatial resolution of ∼0″.13, which, combined with their depth, makes them a unique resource for studying galaxy evolution. We present an overview of the preliminary reduction and analysis of the grism observations, including emission-line and redshift measurements from combined fits to the extracted grism spectra and photometry from ancillary multi-wavelength catalogs. The present analysis yields redshift estimates with a precision of $\sigma$(z) = 0.0034(1 + z), or $\sigma$(v) 1000kms -1. We illustrate how the generalized nature of the survey yields near-infrared spectra of remarkable quality for many different types of objects, including a quasar at z = 4.7, quiescent galaxies at z ∼ 2, and the most distant T-type brown dwarf star known. The combination of the CANDELS and 3D-HST surveys will provide the definitive imaging and spectroscopic data set for studies of the 1 {\textless} z {\textless} 3.5 universe until the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope. {\textcopyright} 2012.

abstract = {Since more than 70 years ago, the colours of galaxies derived from flux measurements at different wavelengths have been used to estimate their cosmological distances. Such distance measurements, called photometric redshifts, are necessary for many scientific projects, ranging from investigations of the formation and evolution of galaxies and active galactic nuclei to precision cosmology. The primary benefit of photometric redshifts is that distance estimates can be obtained relatively cheaply for all sources detected in photometric images. The drawback is that these cheap estimates have low precision compared with resource-expensive spectroscopic ones. The methodology for estimating redshifts has been through several revolutions in recent decades, triggered by increasingly stringent requirements on the photometric redshift accuracy. Here, we review the various techniques for obtaining photometric redshifts, from template-fitting to machine learning and hybrid schemes. We also describe state-of-the-art results on current extragalactic samples and explain how survey strategy choices affect redshift accuracy. We close with a description of the photometric redshift efforts planned for upcoming wide-field surveys, which will collect data on billions of galaxies, aiming to investigate, among other matters, the stellar mass assembly and the nature of dark energy.},

abstract = {With the growth of large photometric surveys, accurately estimating photometric redshifts, preferably as a probability density function (PDF), and fully understanding the implicit systematic uncertainties in this process, has become increasingly important. In this paper, we present a new, publicly available, parallel, machine learning algorithm that generates photometric redshift PDFs by using prediction trees and random forest techniques, which we have named TPZ.1 This new algorithm incorporates measurement errors into the calculation while also dealing efficiently with missing values in the data. In addition, our implementation of this algorithm provides supplementary information regarding the data being analysed, including unbiased estimates of the accuracy of the technique without resorting to a validation data set, identification of poor photometric redshift areas within the parameter space occupied by the spectroscopic training data, a quantification of the relative importance of the variables used to construct the PDF, and a robust identification of outliers. This extra information can be used to optimally target new spectroscopic observations and to improve the overall efficacy of the redshift estimation. We have tested TPZ on galaxy samples drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) main galaxy sample and from the Deep Extragalactic Evolutionary Probe-2 (DEEP2) survey,obtaining excellent results in each case. We also have tested our implementation by participating in the PHAT1 project, which is a blind photometric redshift contest, finding that TPZ performs comparable to if not better than other empirical photometric redshift algorithms. Finally, we discuss the various parameters that control the operation of TPZ, the specific limitations of this approach and an application of photometric redshift PDFs. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

abstract = {Many scientific investigations of photometric galaxy surveys require redshift estimates , whose uncertainty properties are best encapsulated by photometric redshift (photo-z) posterior probability density functions (PDFs). A plethora of photo-z PDF estimation methodologies abound, producing discrepant results with no consensus on a preferred approach. We present the results of a comprehensive experiment comparing twelve photo-z algorithms applied to mock data produced for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC). By supplying perfect prior information, in the form of the complete template library and a representative training set as inputs to each code, we demonstrate the impact of the assumptions underlying each technique on the output photo-z PDFs. In the absence of a notion of true, unbiased photo-z PDFs, we evaluate and interpret multiple metrics of the ensemble properties of the derived photo-z PDFs as well as traditional reductions to photo-z point estimates. We report systematic biases and overall over/under-breadth of the photo-z PDFs of many popular codes, which may indicate avenues for improvement in the algorithms or implementations. Furthermore, we raise attention to the limitations of established metrics for assessing photo-z PDF accuracy; though we identify the conditional density estimate (CDE) loss as a promising metric of photo-z PDF performance in the case where true redshifts are available but true photo-z PDFs are not, we emphasize the need for science-specific performance metrics.},

abstract = {We describe a new program for determining photometric redshifts, dubbed EAZY. The program is optimized for cases where spectroscopic redshifts are not available, or only available for a biased subset of the galaxies. The code combines features from various existing codes: it can fit linear combinations of templates, it includes optional flux- and redshift-based priors, and its user interface is modeled on the popular HYPERZ code. A novel feature is that the default template set, as well as the default functional forms of the priors, are not based on (usually highly biased) spectroscopic samples, but on semi-analytical models. Furthermore, template mismatch is addressed by a novel rest-frame template error function. This function gives different wavelength regions different weights, and ensures that the formal redshift uncertainties are realistic. We introduce a redshift quality parameter, Q{\_}z, that provides a robust estimate of the reliability of the photometric redshift estimate. Despite the fact that EAZY is not "trained" on spectroscopic samples, the code (with default parameters) performs very well on existing public datasets. For K-selected samples in CDF-South and other deep fields we find a 1-sigma scatter in dz/(1+z) of 0.034, and we provide updated photometric redshift catalogs for the FIRES, MUSYC, and FIREWORKS surveys.},

abstract = {Measuring the physical properties of galaxies such as redshift frequently requires the use of Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs). SED template sets are, however, often small in number and cover limited portions of photometric color space. Here we present a new method to estimate SEDs as a function of color from a small training set of template SEDs. We first cover the mathematical background behind the technique before demonstrating our ability to reconstruct spectra based upon colors and then compare to other common interpolation and extrapolation methods. When the photometric filters and spectra overlap we show reduction of error in the estimated spectra of over 65{\%} compared to the more commonly used techniques. We also show an expansion of the method to wavelengths beyond the range of the photometric filters. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of our technique by generating 50 additional SED templates from an original set of 10 and applying the new set to photometric redshift estimation. We are able to reduce the photometric redshifts standard deviation by at least 22.0{\%} and the outlier rejected bias by over 86.2{\%} compared to original set for z {\$}\backslashleq{\$} 3.},

The survey data will allow us to measure the dark energy and dark matter densities and the dark energy equation of state through four independent methods: galaxy clusters, weak gravitational lensing tomography, galaxy angular clustering, and supernova distances. These methods are doubly complementary: they constrain different combinations of cosmological model parameters and are subject to different systematic errors. By deriving the four sets of measurements from the same data set with a common analysis framework, we will obtain important cross checks of the systematic errors and thereby make a substantial and robust advance in the precision of dark energy measurements.},

abstract = {This paper describes the CFH12K-VIRMOS survey: a deep BVRI imaging survey in four fields totalling more than 17 deg2, conducted with the 40 × 30 arcmin2 field CFH-12K camera. The survey is intended to be a multi-purpose survey used for a variety of science goals, including surveys of very high redshift galaxies and weak lensing studies. Four high galactic latitude fields, each 2 × 2 deg2, have been selected along the celestial equator: 0226-04, 1003+01, 1400+05, and 2217+00. The 16 deg 2 of the "wide" survey are covered with exposure times of 2 hr, 1.5 hr, 1 hr, 1 hr, respectively while the 1.3 × 1 deg2 area of the "deep" survey at the center of the 0226-04 field is covered with exposure times of 7 h, 4.5 h, 3 h, 3 h, in BVRI respectively. An additional area ∼2 deg2 has been imaged in the 0226-04 field corresponding to the area surveyed by the XMM-LSS program (Pierre et al. 2003). The data is pipeline processed at the Terapix facility at the Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris to produce large mosaic images. The catalogs produced contain the positions, shapes, total and aperture magnitudes for 2.175 million objects measured in the four areas. The limiting magnitudes, measured as a 5$\sigma$ measurement in a 3 arcsec diameter aperture is IAB = 24.8 in the "Wide" areas, and IAB = 25.3 in the deep area. Careful quality control has been applied on the data to ensure internal consistency and assess the photometric and astrometric accuracy as described in a joint paper (McCracken et al. 2003). These catalogs are used to select targets for the VIRMOS-VLT Deep Survey, a large spectroscopic survey of the distant universe (Le F{\`{e}}vre et al. 2003). First results from the CFH12K-VIRMOS survey have been published on weak lensing (e.g. van Waerbeke {\&} Mellier 2003).

The SDT was chartered to work with the WFIRST Project Office at GSFC and the Program Office at JPL to produce a Design Reference Mission (DRM) for WFIRST. Part of the original charge was to produce an interim design reference mission by mid-2011. That document was delivered to NASA and widely circulated within the astronomical community. In late 2011 the Astrophysics Division augmented its original charge, asking for two design reference missions. The first of these, DRM1, was to be a finalized version of the interim DRM, reducing overall mission costs where possible. The second of these, DRM2, was to identify and eliminate capabilities that overlapped with those of NASA's James Webb Space Telescope (henceforth JWST), ESA's Euclid mission, and the NSF's ground-based Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (henceforth LSST), and again to reduce overall mission cost, while staying faithful to NWNH.

abstract = {Understanding how the physical properties of galaxies (e.g., their spectral type or age) evolve as a function of redshift relies on having an accurate representation of galaxy spectral energy distributions. While it has been known for some time that galaxy spectra can be reconstructed from a handful of orthogonal basis templates, the underlying basis is poorly constrained. The limiting factor has been the lack of large samples of galaxies (covering a wide range in spectral type) with high signal-to-noise spectrophotometric observations. To alleviate this problem we introduce here a new technique for recon-structing galaxy spectral energy distributions directly from samples of galaxies with broadband photo-metric data and spectroscopic redshifts. Exploiting the statistical approach of the Karhunen - Lo{\`{e}} ve expansion , our iterative training procedure increasingly improves the eigenbasis , so that it provides better agreement with the photometry .

This region, consisting of four contiguous pointings of the CFH12K wide-field mosaic camera, covers a total area of 1.2 deg2. The survey reaches a limiting magnitude of BAB ∼ 26.5, VAB ∼ 26.2, RAB ∼ 25.9 and IAB ∼ 25.0 (corresponding to the point at which our recovery rate for simulated point-like sources sources falls below 50{\%}). In total the survey contains 90 729 extended sources in the magnitude range 18.0 {\textless} IAB {\textless} 24.0. We demonstrate our catalogues are free from systematic biases and are complete and reliable down these limits. By comparing our galaxy number counts to previous wide-field CCD surveys, we estimate that the upper limit on bin-to-bin systematic photometric errors for the I- limited sample is ∼ 10{\%} in this magnitude range. We estimate that 68{\%} of the catalogues sources have absolute per co-ordinate astrometric uncertainties less than |$\Delta$$\alpha$| ∼ 0.38″ and |$\Delta$$\delta$| ∼ 0.32″. Our internal (filter-to-filter) per co-ordinate astrometric uncertainties are |$\Delta$$\alpha$| ∼ 0.08″ and |$\Delta$$\delta$| ∼ 0.08″. We quantify the completeness of our survey in the joint space defined by object total magnitude and peak surface brightness. We also demonstrate that no significant positional incompleteness effects are present in our catalogues to IAB {\textless} 24.0. Finally, we present numerous comparisons between our catalogues and published literature data: galaxy and star counts, galaxy and stellar colours, and the clustering of both point-like and extended populations. In all cases our measurements are in excellent agreement with literature data to IAB {\textless} 24.0. This combination of depth and areal coverage makes this multi-colour catalogue a solid foundation to select galaxies for follow-up spectroscopy with VIMOS on the ESO-VLT and a unique database to study the formation and evolution of the faint galaxy population to z ∼ 1 and beyond.},

abstract = {We describe the design and data analysis of the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey, the densest and largest high-precision redshift survey of galaxies at z ∼ 1 completed to date. The survey was designed to conduct a comprehensive census of massive galaxies, their properties, environments, and large-scale structure down to absolute magnitude MB = -20 at z ∼ 1 via ∼90 nights of observation on the Keck telescope. The survey covers an area of 2.8 deg2 divided into four separate fields observed to a limiting apparent magnitude of RAB = 24.1. Objects with z ≲ 0.7 are readily identifiable using BRI photometry and rejected in three of the four DEEP2 fields, allowing galaxies with z {\textgreater} 0.7 to be targeted ∼2.5 times more efficiently than in a purely magnitude-limited sample. Approximately 60{\%} of eligible targets are chosen for spectroscopy, yielding nearly 53,000 spectra and more than 38,000 reliable redshift measurements. Most of the targets that fail to yield secure redshifts are blue objects that lie beyond z ∼ 1.45, where the [O II] 3727 {\AA} doublet lies in the infrared. The DEIMOS 1200 line mm-1 grating used for the survey delivers high spectral resolution (R ∼ 6000), accurate and secure redshifts, and unique internal kinematic information. Extensive ancillary data are available in the DEEP2 fields, particularly in the Extended Groth Strip, which has evolved into one of the richest multiwavelength regions on the sky. This paper is intended as a handbook for users of the DEEP2 Data Release 4, which includes all DEEP2 spectra and redshifts, as well as for the DEEP2 DEIMOS data reduction pipelines. Extensive details are provided on object selection, mask design, biases in target selection and redshift measurements, the spec2d two-dimensional data-reduction pipeline, the spec1d automated redshift pipeline, and the zspec visual redshift verification process, along with examples of instrumental signatures or other artifacts that in some cases remain after data reduction. Redshift errors and catastrophic failure rates are assessed through more than 2000 objects with duplicate observations. Sky subtraction is essentially photon-limited even under bright OH sky lines; we describe the strategies that permitted this, based on high image stability, accurate wavelength solutions, and powerful B-spline modeling methods. We also investigate the impact of targets that appear to be single objects in ground-based targeting imaging but prove to be composite in Hubble Space Telescope data; they constitute several percent of targets at z ∼ 1, approaching ∼5{\%}-10{\%} at z {\textgreater} 1.5. Summary data are given that demonstrate the superiority of DEEP2 over other deep high-precision redshift surveys at z ∼ 1 in terms of redshift accuracy, sample number density, and amount of spectral information. We also provide an overview of the scientific highlights of the DEEP2 survey thus far. {\textcopyright} 2013. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {There is a growing demand for nonparametric conditional density estimators (CDEs) in fields such as astronomy and economics. In astronomy, for example, one can dramatically improve estimates of the parameters that dictate the evolution of the Universe by working with full conditional densities instead of regression (i.e., conditional mean) estimates. More generally, standard regression falls short in any prediction problem where the distribution of the response is more complex with multi-modality, asymmetry or heteroscedastic noise. Nevertheless, much of the work on high-dimensional inference concerns regression and classification only, whereas research on density estimation has lagged behind. Here we propose FlexCode, a fully nonparametric approach to conditional density estimation that reformulates CDE as a non-parametric orthogonal series problem where the expansion coefficients are estimated by regression. By taking such an approach, one can efficiently estimate conditional densities and not just expectations in high dimensions by drawing upon the success in high-dimensional regression. Depending on the choice of regression procedure, our method can adapt to a variety of challenging high-dimensional settings with different structures in the data (e.g., a large number of irrelevant components and nonlinear manifold structure) as well as different data types (e.g., functional data, mixed data types and sample sets). We study the theoretical and empirical performance of our proposed method, and we compare our approach with traditional conditional density estimators on simulated as well as real-world data, such as photometric galaxy data, Twitter data, and line-of-sight velocities in a galaxy cluster.},

abstract = {We present reduced data and data products from the 3D-HST survey, a 248-orbit HST Treasury program. The survey obtained WFC3 G141 grism spectroscopy in four of the five CANDELS fields: AEGIS, COSMOS, GOODS-S, and UDS, along with WFC3 {\$}H{\_}{\{}140{\}}{\$} imaging, parallel ACS G800L spectroscopy, and parallel {\$}I{\_}{\{}814{\}}{\$} imaging. In a previous paper (Skelton et al. 2014) we presented photometric catalogs in these four fields and in GOODS-N, the fifth CANDELS field. Here we describe and present the WFC3 G141 spectroscopic data, again augmented with data from GO-1600 in GOODS-N. The data analysis is complicated by the fact that no slits are used: all objects in the WFC3 field are dispersed, and many spectra overlap. We developed software to automatically and optimally extract interlaced 2D and 1D spectra for all objects in the Skelton et al. (2014) photometric catalogs. The 2D spectra and the multi-band photometry were fit simultaneously to determine redshifts and emission line strengths, taking the morphology of the galaxies explicitly into account. The resulting catalog has 98,663 measured redshifts and line strengths down to {\$}JH{\_}{\{}IR{\}}\backslashleq 26{\$} and 22,548 with {\$}JH{\_}{\{}IR{\}}\backslashleq 24{\$}, where we comfortably detect continuum emission. Of this sample 5,459 galaxies are at {\$}z{\textgreater}1.5{\$} and 9,621 are at {\$}0.7{\textless}z{\textless}1.5{\$}, where H{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} falls in the G141 wavelength coverage. Based on comparisons with ground-based spectroscopic redshifts, and on analyses of paired galaxies and repeat observations, the typical redshift error for {\$}JH{\_}{\{}IR{\}}\backslashleq 24{\$} galaxies in our catalog is {\$}\backslashsigma{\_}z \backslashapprox 0.003 \backslashtimes (1+z){\$}, i.e., one native WFC3 pixel. The {\$}3\backslashsigma{\$} limit for emission line fluxes of point sources is {\$}1.5\backslashtimes10{\^{}}{\{}-17{\}}{\$} ergs s{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} cm{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}{\$}. We show various representations of the full dataset, as well as individual examples that highlight the range of spectra that we find in the survey.},

abstract = {Context. Deep representative surveys of galaxies at different epochs are needed to make progress in understanding galaxy evolution. Aims. We describe the completed VIMOS VLT Deep Survey and the final data release of 35 016 galaxies and type-I AGN with measured spectroscopic redshifts covering all epochs up to redshift z ∼ 6.7, in areas from 0.142 to 8.7 square degrees, and volumes from 0.5×106 to 2×107 h-3 Mpc 3. Methods. We selected samples of galaxies based solely on their i-band magnitude reaching iAB = 24.75. Spectra were obtained with VIMOS on the ESO-VLT integrating 0.75 h, 4.5 h, and 18 h for the Wide, Deep, and Ultra-Deep nested surveys, respectively. We demonstrate that any "redshift desert" can be crossed successfully using spectra covering 3650 ≤ $\lambda$ ≤ 9350 A. A total of 1263 galaxies were again observed independently within the VVDS and from the VIPERS and MASSIV surveys. They were used to establish the redshift measurements reliability, to assess completeness in the VVDS sample, and to provide a weighting scheme taking the survey selection function into account. We describe the main properties of the VVDS samples, and the VVDS is compared to other spectroscopic surveys in the literature. Results. In total we have obtained spectroscopic redshifts for 34 594 galaxies, 422 type-I AGN, and 12 430 Galactic stars. The survey enabled identifying galaxies up to very high redshifts with 4669 redshifts in 1 ≤ zspec ≤ 2, 561 in 2 ≤ zspec ≤ 3, and 468 with zspec {\textgreater} 3, and specific populations like Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters were identified out to z = 6.62.We show that the VVDS occupies a unique place in the parameter space defined by area, depth, redshift coverage, and number of spectra. Conclusions. The VIMOS VLT Deep Survey provides a comprehensive survey of the distant universe, covering all epochs since z ∼ 6, or more than 12 Gyr of cosmic time, with a uniform selection, which is the largest such sample to date. A wealth of science results derived from the VVDS have shed new light on the evolution of galaxies and AGN and on their distribution in space over this large cosmic time. The VVDS further demonstrates that large deep spectroscopic redshift surveys over all these epochs in the distant Universe are a key tool to observational cosmology. To enhance the legacy value of the survey, a final public release of the complete VVDS spectroscopic redshift sample is available at http://cesam.lam.fr/vvds. {\textcopyright} 2013 ESO.},

abstract = {We present accurate photometric redshifts (photo-z) in the 2-deg 2 COSMOS field. The redshifts are computed with 30 broad, intermediate, and narrowbands covering the UV (Galaxy Evolution Explorer), visible near-IR (NIR; Subaru, Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), United Kingdom Infrared Telescope, and National Optical Astronomy Observatory), and mid-IR (Spitzer/IRAC). A $\chi$2 template-fitting method (Le Phare) was used and calibrated with large spectroscopic samples from the Very Large Telescope Visible Multi-Object Spectrograph and the Keck Deep Extragalactic Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph. We develop and implement a new method which accounts for the contributions from emission lines ([OII], H$\beta$, H$\alpha$, and Ly$\alpha$) to the spectral energy distributions (SEDs). The treatment of emission lines improves the photo-z accuracy by a factor of 2.5. Comparison of the derived photo-z with 4148 spectroscopic redshifts (i.e., $\Delta$z = z s - z p) indicates a dispersion of at i +AB {\textless} 22.5, a factor of 2-6 times more accurate than earlier photo-z in the COSMOS, CFHT Legacy Survey, and the Classifying Object by Medium-Band Observations-17 survey fields. At fainter magnitudes i +AB {\textless} 24 and z {\textless} 1.25, the accuracy is . The deep NIR and Infrared Array Camera coverage enables the photo-z to be extended to z 2, albeit with a lower accuracy ( at i +AB 24). The redshift distribution of large magnitude-selected samples is derived and the median redshift is found to range from z m = 0.66 at 22 {\textless} i +AB {\textless} 22.5 to z m = 1.06 at 24.5 {\textless} i +AB {\textless} 25. At i +AB {\textless} 26.0, the multiwavelength COSMOS catalog includes approximately 607,617 objects. The COSMOS-30 photo-z enables the full exploitation of this survey for studies of galaxy and large-scale structure evolution at high redshift. {\textcopyright} 2009.
