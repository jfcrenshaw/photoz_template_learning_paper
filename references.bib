abstract = {We present 3D-HST, a near-infrared spectroscopic Treasury program with the Hubble Space Telescope for studying the physical processes that shape galaxies in the distant universe. 3D-HST provides rest-frame optical spectra for a sample of ∼7000 galaxies at 1 {\textless} z {\textless} 3.5, the epoch when 60{\%} of all star formation took place, the number density of quasars peaked, the first galaxies stopped forming stars, and the structural regularity that we see in galaxies today must have emerged. 3D-HST will cover three quarters (625arcmin 2) of the CANDELS Treasury survey area with two orbits of primary WFC3/G141 grism coverage and two to four orbits with the ACS/G800L grism in parallel. In the IR, these exposure times yield a continuum signal-to-noise ratio of 5per resolution element at H 140 ∼ 23.1 and a 5$\sigma$ emission-line sensitivity of ∼5 × 10 -17 erg s -1 cm -2 for typical objects, improving by a factor of ∼2 for compact sources in images with low sky background levels. The WFC3/G141 spectra provide continuous wavelength coverage from 1.1 to 1.6 $\mu$m at a spatial resolution of ∼0″.13, which, combined with their depth, makes them a unique resource for studying galaxy evolution. We present an overview of the preliminary reduction and analysis of the grism observations, including emission-line and redshift measurements from combined fits to the extracted grism spectra and photometry from ancillary multi-wavelength catalogs. The present analysis yields redshift estimates with a precision of $\sigma$(z) = 0.0034(1 + z), or $\sigma$(v) 1000kms -1. We illustrate how the generalized nature of the survey yields near-infrared spectra of remarkable quality for many different types of objects, including a quasar at z = 4.7, quiescent galaxies at z ∼ 2, and the most distant T-type brown dwarf star known. The combination of the CANDELS and 3D-HST surveys will provide the definitive imaging and spectroscopic data set for studies of the 1 {\textless} z {\textless} 3.5 universe until the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope. {\textcopyright} 2012.

abstract = {In this paper we present and characterize a nearest-neighbors color-matching photometric redshift estimator that features a direct relationship between the precision and accuracy of the input magnitudes and the output photometric redshifts. This aspect makes our estimator an ideal tool for evaluating the impact of changes to LSST survey parameters that affect the measurement errors of the photometry, which is the main motivation of our work (i.e., it is not intended to provide the "best" photometric redshifts for LSST data). We show how the photometric redshifts will improve with time over the 10-year LSST survey and confirm that the nominal distribution of visits per filter provides the most accurate photo-{\$}z{\$} results. The LSST survey strategy naturally produces observations over a range of airmass, which offers the opportunity of using an SED- and {\$}z{\$}-dependent atmospheric affect on the observed photometry as a color-independent redshift indicator. We show that measuring this airmass effect and including it as a prior has the potential to improve the photometric redshifts and can ameliorate extreme outliers, but that it will only be adequately measured for the brightest galaxies, which limits its overall impact on LSST photometric redshifts. We furthermore demonstrate how this airmass effect can induce a bias in the photo-{\$}z{\$} results, and caution against survey strategies that prioritize high-airmass observations for the purpose of improving this prior. Ultimately, we intend for this work to serve as a guide for the expectations and preparations of the LSST science community with regards to the minimum quality of photo-{\$}z{\$} as the survey progresses.},

abstract = {We present aperture-matched PSF-corrected BVi'z'JH photometry and Bayesian photometric redshifts (BPZ) for objects detected in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (UDF), 8,042 of which are detected at the 10-sigma level (e.g., i'{\textless}29.01 or z'{\textless}28.43). Most of our objects are defined identically to those in the public STScI catalogs, enabling straightforward object-by-object comparison. We have combined detections from i', z', J+H, and B+V+i'+z' images into a single comprehensive segmentation map. Using a new program called SExSeg we are able to force this segmentation map into SExtractor for photometric analysis. The resulting photometry is corrected for the wider NIC3 PSFs using our ColorPro software. We also correct for the ACS z'-band PSF halo. The NIC3 magnitudes are found to be too faint relative to the ACS fluxes. Based on BPZ SED fits to objects of know spectroscopic redshift, we derived corrections of -0.30 +/- 0.03 mag in J and -0.18 +/- 0.04 mag in H. The offsets appear to be supported by a recent recalibration of the UDF NIC3 images combined with non-linearity measured in NICMOS itself. The UDF reveals a large population of faint blue galaxies (presumably young starbursts), bluer than those observed in the original Hubble Deep Fields (HDF). To accommodate these galaxies, we have added two new starburst templates to the SED library used in previous BPZ papers. The resulting photometric redshifts are accurate to within 0.04 * 1+z{\_}spec out to z {\textless} 6. Finally, we measure galaxy morphology, including Sersic index and asymmetry.

abstract = {This paper describes the CFH12K-VIRMOS survey: a deep BVRI imaging survey in four fields totalling more than 17 deg2, conducted with the 40 × 30 arcmin2 field CFH-12K camera. The survey is intended to be a multi-purpose survey used for a variety of science goals, including surveys of very high redshift galaxies and weak lensing studies. Four high galactic latitude fields, each 2 × 2 deg2, have been selected along the celestial equator: 0226-04, 1003+01, 1400+05, and 2217+00. The 16 deg 2 of the "wide" survey are covered with exposure times of 2 hr, 1.5 hr, 1 hr, 1 hr, respectively while the 1.3 × 1 deg2 area of the "deep" survey at the center of the 0226-04 field is covered with exposure times of 7 h, 4.5 h, 3 h, 3 h, in BVRI respectively. An additional area ∼2 deg2 has been imaged in the 0226-04 field corresponding to the area surveyed by the XMM-LSS program (Pierre et al. 2003). The data is pipeline processed at the Terapix facility at the Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris to produce large mosaic images. The catalogs produced contain the positions, shapes, total and aperture magnitudes for 2.175 million objects measured in the four areas. The limiting magnitudes, measured as a 5$\sigma$ measurement in a 3 arcsec diameter aperture is IAB = 24.8 in the "Wide" areas, and IAB = 25.3 in the deep area. Careful quality control has been applied on the data to ensure internal consistency and assess the photometric and astrometric accuracy as described in a joint paper (McCracken et al. 2003). These catalogs are used to select targets for the VIRMOS-VLT Deep Survey, a large spectroscopic survey of the distant universe (Le F{\`{e}}vre et al. 2003). First results from the CFH12K-VIRMOS survey have been published on weak lensing (e.g. van Waerbeke {\&} Mellier 2003). Catalogs and images are available through the VIRMOS database environment under Oracle (http://www.oamp.fr/cencos). They are open for general use since July 1st, 2003.},

abstract = {Understanding how the physical properties of galaxies (e.g., their spectral type or age) evolve as a function of redshift relies on having an accurate representation of galaxy spectral energy distributions. While it has been known for some time that galaxy spectra can be reconstructed from a handful of orthogonal basis templates, the underlying basis is poorly constrained. The limiting factor has been the lack of large samples of galaxies (covering a wide range in spectral type) with high signal-to-noise spectrophotometric observations. To alleviate this problem we introduce here a new technique for recon-structing galaxy spectral energy distributions directly from samples of galaxies with broadband photo-metric data and spectroscopic redshifts. Exploiting the statistical approach of the Karhunen - Lo{\`{e}} ve expansion , our iterative training procedure increasingly improves the eigenbasis , so that it provides better agreement with the photometry . We demonstrate the utility of this approach by applying these improved spectral energy distributions to the estimation of photometric redshifts for the HDF sample of galaxies .

Using simulations we determine the best SExtractor $\backslash$nparameters for the detection of faint galaxies in deep Hubble Space $\backslash$nTelescope observations, paying special attention to the issue of $\backslash$ndeblending, which significantly affects the normalization and shape of $\backslash$nthe number count distribution. We confirm, as claimed by Bernstein, $\backslash$nFreedman, {\&} Madore, that Kron-like magnitudes, such as the ones $\backslash$ngenerated by SExtractor, can miss more than half of the light of faint $\backslash$ngalaxies, what dramatically affects the slope of the number counts.

abstract = {Template UV-optical spectra of quiescent and starburst galaxies are presented and used to derive K-corrections as a function of morphological type and redshift. IUE observations and archival data are used for the UV template spectra. The optical spectra are from ground-based observations obtained in apertures that match closely the 200 arcsec{\^{}}2{\^{}} IUE aperture. The templates of quiescent galaxies are built according to morphological type, elliptical, bulge, S0, Sa, Sb, and Sc, and the templates of starburst galaxies according to color excess. The unprecedented characteristics of these templates is that UV and optical spectra have been obtained in matched apertures to produce consistent spectral information from 1200 to 10,000 A, Despite the relatively small IUE aperture, the galaxy stellar populations are well represented in the elliptical, S0, Sa, and Sc, and in the starburst templates. The spectra are available digitally. The UV-optical templates can be applied to the classification of high- redshift galaxies and to the identification of the host galaxies of quasars. The templates predict that observed magnitudes from traditional ground-based photometric surveys can be uniquely interpreted. For example, U, B, and I magnitudes uniquely determine both the redshift and the morphological type of a galaxy. The template spectra are also used to calculate K-corrections for galaxies as a function of morphological type and redshift, up to z = 2. These improved K-corrections are not sufficient to explain the excess counts in faint blue galaxies. A subset of our galaxy templates are linked with published data from the radio to the X-ray for galaxies and quasars. A comparison between the quiescent galaxies and the quasars suggests that, in the optical band, the host galaxy is a factor of 10-100 fainter in flux than the quasar.},

The surveys include an all-sky imaging survey (mAB ≃ 20.5), a medium imaging survey of 1000 deg2 (mAB ≃ 23), a deep imaging survey of 100 deg2 (mAB ≃ 25), and a nearby galaxy survey.

We will use the measured UV properties of local galaxies, along with corollary observations, to calibrate the relationship of the UV and global star formation rate in local galaxies. We will apply this calibration to distant galaxies discovered in the deep imaging and spectroscopic surveys to map the history of star formation in the universe over the redshift range 0 {\textless} z {\textless} 2 and probe the physical drivers of star formation in galaxies.

The data includes ugriz photometry from Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS) and Y-band photometry from the Subaru Suprime camera, as well as spectroscopic redshifts from the DEEP2, DEEP3, and 3D-HST surveys. These catalogues incorporate corrections to produce effectively matched-aperture photometry across all bands, based upon object size information available in the catalogue and Moffat profile point spread function fits. We test this catalogue with a simple machine learning-based photometric redshift algorithm based upon Random Forest regression, and find that the corrected aperture photometry leads to significant improvement in photo-z accuracy compared to the original SExtractor catalogues from CFHTLS and Subaru. The deep ugrizY photometry and spectroscopic redshifts are well suited for empirical tests of photometric redshift algorithms for LSST. The resulting catalogues are publicly available at http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/36064/. We include a basic summary of the strategy of the DEEP3 Galaxy Redshift Survey to accompany the recent public release of DEEP3 data.},

abstract = {We present spectroscopic redshifts of a large sample of galaxies with I AB {\textless} 22.5 in the COSMOS field, measured from spectra of 10,644 objects that have been obtained in the first two years of observations in the zCOSMOS-bright redshift survey. These include a statistically complete subset of 10,109 objects. The average accuracy of individual redshifts is 110 km s -1, independent of redshift. The reliability of individual redshifts is described by a Confidence Class that has been empirically calibrated through repeat spectroscopic observations of over 600 galaxies. There is very good agreement between spectroscopic and photometric redshifts for the most secure Confidence Classes. For the less secure Confidence Classes, there is a good correspondence between the fraction of objects with a consistent photometric redshift and the spectroscopic repeatability, suggesting that the photometric redshifts can be used to indicate which of the less secure spectroscopic redshifts are likely right and which are probably wrong, and to give an indication of the nature of objects for which we failed to determine a redshift. Using this approach, we can construct a spectroscopic sample that is 99{\%} reliable and which is 88{\%} complete in the sample as a whole, and 95{\%} complete in the redshift range 0.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.8. The luminosity and mass completeness levels of the zCOSMOS-bright sample of galaxies is also discussed. {\textcopyright} 2009. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Refraction by the atmosphere causes the positions of sources to depend on the airmass through which an observation was taken. This shift is dependent on the underlying spectral energy of the source and the filter or bandpass through which it is observed. Wavelength-dependent refraction within a single passband is often referred to as differential chromatic refraction (DCR). With a new generation of astronomical surveys undertaking repeated observations of the same part of the sky over a range of different airmasses and parallactic angles, DCR should be a detectable and measurable astrometric signal. In this paper we introduce a novel procedure that takes this astrometric signal and uses it to infer the underlying spectral energy distribution of a source; we solve for multiple latent images at specific wavelengths via a generalized deconvolution procedure built on robust statistics. We demonstrate the utility of such an approach for estimating a partially deconvolved image, at higher spectral resolution than the input images, for surveys such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.},

The sample is magnitude limited to iAB ≤22.5, with an additional colour-colour pre-selection devised as to exclude galaxies at z {\textless} 0:5. This practically doubles the effective sampling of the VIMOS spectrograph over the range 0:5 {\textless} z {\textless} 1:2 (reaching 47{\%} on average), yielding a final median local galaxy density close to 5 × 10-3 h-3 Mpc-3. The total area spanned by the final data set is '23:5 deg2, corresponding to 288 VIMOS fields with marginal overlaps, split over two regions within the CFHTLSWide W1 and W4 equatorial fields (at RA ≃ 2 and ≃ 22 h, respectively). Spectra were observed at a resolution R = 220, covering a wavelength range 55009500 {\AA}. Data reduction and redshift measurements were performed through a fully automated pipeline; all redshift determinations were then visually validated and assigned a quality flag. Measurements with a quality flag ≥2 are shown to have a confidence level of 96{\%} or larger and make up 88{\%} of all measured galaxy redshifts (76 552 out of 86 775), constituting the VIPERS prime catalogue for statistical investigations. For this sample the rms redshift error, estimated using repeated measurements of about 3000 galaxies, is found to be $\sigma$z = 0:00054(1 + z).

The library of spectra assembled here supersedes other existing libraries by its spectral range, its complete coverage of the color-magnitude diagram, and its inclusion of observed near-infrared spectra out to 2.56 micron. Also, the spectra are distributed on the stellar evolutionary tracks using optical/near-infrared color calibrations, as an improvement over models that used a single color of the effective temperature of the stars alone. The spectroscopic results obtained here confirm and extend the previous photometric predictions of the isochrone synthesis models while including the recent revision of evolutionary tracks for stars between 1.3 and 2.5 solar masses by their authors.},

These predictions are based on a newly available library of observed stellar spectra. We also compute the spectral evolution across a larger wavelength range, from 91 {\AA} to 160 $\mu$m, at lower resolution. The model incorporates recent progress in stellar evolution theory and an observationally motivated prescription for thermally pulsing stars on the asymptotic giant branch. The latter is supported by observations of surface brightness fluctuations in nearby stellar populations. We show that this model reproduces well the observed optical and near-infrared colour-magnitude diagrams of Galactic star clusters of various ages and metallicities. Stochastic fluctuations in the numbers of stars in different evolutionary phases can account for the full range of observed integrated colours of star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds. The model reproduces in detail typical galaxy spectra from the Early Data Release (EDR) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We exemplify how this type of spectral fit can constrain physical parameters such as the star formation history, metallicity and dust content of galaxies. Our model is the first to enable accurate studies of absorption-line strengths in galaxies containing stars over the full range of ages. Using the highest-quality spectra of the SDSS EDR, we show that this model can reproduce simultaneously the observed strengths of those Lick indices that do not depend strongly on element abundance ratios. The interpretation of such indices with our model should be particularly useful for constraining the star formation histories and metallicities of galaxies.},

abstract = {We present accurate photometric redshifts (photo-z) in the 2-deg 2 COSMOS field. The redshifts are computed with 30 broad, intermediate, and narrowbands covering the UV (Galaxy Evolution Explorer), visible near-IR (NIR; Subaru, Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), United Kingdom Infrared Telescope, and National Optical Astronomy Observatory), and mid-IR (Spitzer/IRAC). A $\chi$2 template-fitting method (Le Phare) was used and calibrated with large spectroscopic samples from the Very Large Telescope Visible Multi-Object Spectrograph and the Keck Deep Extragalactic Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph. We develop and implement a new method which accounts for the contributions from emission lines ([OII], H$\beta$, H$\alpha$, and Ly$\alpha$) to the spectral energy distributions (SEDs). The treatment of emission lines improves the photo-z accuracy by a factor of 2.5. Comparison of the derived photo-z with 4148 spectroscopic redshifts (i.e., $\Delta$z = z s - z p) indicates a dispersion of at i +AB {\textless} 22.5, a factor of 2-6 times more accurate than earlier photo-z in the COSMOS, CFHT Legacy Survey, and the Classifying Object by Medium-Band Observations-17 survey fields. At fainter magnitudes i +AB {\textless} 24 and z {\textless} 1.25, the accuracy is . The deep NIR and Infrared Array Camera coverage enables the photo-z to be extended to z 2, albeit with a lower accuracy ( at i +AB 24).

abstract = {High-resolution spectra are necessary to distinguish and correctly measure the Balmer emission lines due to the presence of strong metal and Balmer absorption features in the stellar continuum. This accurate measurement is necessary for use in emission-line diagnostics, such as the Balmer decrement (i.e. H$\alpha$/H$\beta$), used to determine the attenuation of galaxies. Yet at high redshifts, obtaining such spectra becomes costly. Balmer emission-line equivalent widths are much easier to measure, requiring only low-resolution spectra or even simple narrow-band filters and therefore shorter observation times. However, a correction for the stellar continuum is still needed for this equivalent width Balmer decrement. We present here a statistical analysis of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7 (DR7) emission-line galaxy sample, using the spectrally determined Balmer emission-line fluxes and equivalent widths. Using the large numbers of galaxies available in the SDSS catalogue, we determined an equivalent width Balmer decrement including a statistically based correction for the stellar continuum. Based on this formula, the attenuation of galaxies can now be obtained from low spectral resolution observations. In addition, this investigation also revealed an error in the H$\beta$ line fluxes, within the SDSS DR7 MPA/JHU catalogue, with the equivalent widths underestimated by average ∼0.35{\AA} in the emission-line galaxy sample. This error means that Balmer decrement determined attenuations are overestimated by a systematic 0.1mag in AV, and future analyses of this sample need to include this correction. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society {\textcopyright} 2011 RAS.},

We developed software to automatically and optimally extract interlaced 2D and 1D spectra for all objects in the Skelton et al. (2014) photometric catalogs. The 2D spectra and the multi-band photometry were fit simultaneously to determine redshifts and emission line strengths, taking the morphology of the galaxies explicitly into account.

This region, consisting of four contiguous pointings of the CFH12K wide-field mosaic camera, covers a total area of 1.2 deg2. The survey reaches a limiting magnitude of BAB ∼ 26.5, VAB ∼ 26.2, RAB ∼ 25.9 and IAB ∼ 25.0 (corresponding to the point at which our recovery rate for simulated point-like sources sources falls below 50{\%}). In total the survey contains 90 729 extended sources in the magnitude range 18.0 {\textless} IAB {\textless} 24.0. We demonstrate our catalogues are free from systematic biases and are complete and reliable down these limits. By comparing our galaxy number counts to previous wide-field CCD surveys, we estimate that the upper limit on bin-to-bin systematic photometric errors for the I- limited sample is ∼ 10{\%} in this magnitude range. We estimate that 68{\%} of the catalogues sources have absolute per co-ordinate astrometric uncertainties less than |$\Delta$$\alpha$| ∼ 0.38″ and |$\Delta$$\delta$| ∼ 0.32″. Our internal (filter-to-filter) per co-ordinate astrometric uncertainties are |$\Delta$$\alpha$| ∼ 0.08″ and |$\Delta$$\delta$| ∼ 0.08″. We quantify the completeness of our survey in the joint space defined by object total magnitude and peak surface brightness. We also demonstrate that no significant positional incompleteness effects are present in our catalogues to IAB {\textless} 24.0. Finally, we present numerous comparisons between our catalogues and published literature data: galaxy and star counts, galaxy and stellar colours, and the clustering of both point-like and extended populations. In all cases our measurements are in excellent agreement with literature data to IAB {\textless} 24.0. This combination of depth and areal coverage makes this multi-colour catalogue a solid foundation to select galaxies for follow-up spectroscopy with VIMOS on the ESO-VLT and a unique database to study the formation and evolution of the faint galaxy population to z ∼ 1 and beyond.},

We demonstrate that any "redshift desert" can be crossed successfully using spectra covering 3650 ≤ $\lambda$ ≤ 9350 A. A total of 1263 galaxies were again observed independently within the VVDS and from the VIPERS and MASSIV surveys. They were used to establish the redshift measurements reliability, to assess completeness in the VVDS sample, and to provide a weighting scheme taking the survey selection function into account. We describe the main properties of the VVDS samples, and the VVDS is compared to other spectroscopic surveys in the literature. Results. In total we have obtained spectroscopic redshifts for 34 594 galaxies, 422 type-I AGN, and 12 430 Galactic stars. The survey enabled identifying galaxies up to very high redshifts with 4669 redshifts in 1 ≤ zspec ≤ 2, 561 in 2 ≤ zspec ≤ 3, and 468 with zspec {\textgreater} 3, and specific populations like Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters were identified out to z = 6.62.We show that the VVDS occupies a unique place in the parameter space defined by area, depth, redshift coverage, and number of spectra. Conclusions. The VIMOS VLT Deep Survey provides a comprehensive survey of the distant universe, covering all epochs since z ∼ 6, or more than 12 Gyr of cosmic time, with a uniform selection, which is the largest such sample to date. A wealth of science results derived from the VVDS have shed new light on the evolution of galaxies and AGN and on their distribution in space over this large cosmic time. The VVDS further demonstrates that large deep spectroscopic redshift surveys over all these epochs in the distant Universe are a key tool to observational cosmology. To enhance the legacy value of the survey, a final public release of the complete VVDS spectroscopic redshift sample is available at http://cesam.lam.fr/vvds. {\textcopyright} 2013 ESO.},

abstract = {Measuring the physical properties of galaxies such as redshift frequently requires the use of Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs). SED template sets are, however, often small in number and cover limited portions of photometric color space. Here we present a new method to estimate SEDs as a function of color from a small training set of template SEDs. We first cover the mathematical background behind the technique before demonstrating our ability to reconstruct spectra based upon colors and then compare to other common interpolation and extrapolation methods. When the photometric filters and spectra overlap we show reduction of error in the estimated spectra of over 65{\%} compared to the more commonly used techniques. We also show an expansion of the method to wavelengths beyond the range of the photometric filters. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of our technique by generating 50 additional SED templates from an original set of 10 and applying the new set to photometric redshift estimation. We are able to reduce the photometric redshifts standard deviation by at least 22.0{\%} and the outlier rejected bias by over 86.2{\%} compared to original set for z {\$}\backslashleq{\$} 3.},

abstract = {Canada and France joined a large fraction ({\~{}}50{\%}) of their dark and grey telescope time from mid-2003 to early 2009 for a large project, the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS). The data acquisition and calibration has been a major undertaking for the Canadian and French communities: more than 2300 hours over 5 years (an equivalent of 450 nights) have been devoted to the survey using the wide field optical imaging camera MegaCam, a 1°x1° field of view 340 Megapixel camera. The CFHTLS comprises 2 components: "CFHTLS Deep", 4 independent 1deg2 MegaCam pointing, and "CFHT Wide" comprising 171 MegaCam pointings covering {\~{}}155deg2 in 4 contiguous independent patches. All areas are located far from the galactic plane, and their central positions are: -------------------------------------------------- Field RA (J2000) Dec Galactic position -------------------------------------------------- W1 02:18 -07:00 172.468 -61.24200 172.468 -61.242 W2 08:54 -04:15 232.067 +24.743 W3 14:17:54 +54:30:31 098.850 +58.390 W4 22:13:18 +01:19 063.243 -42.511 D1 02:25:59 -04:29:40 171.993 -58.054 D2 10:00:28 +02:23:30 236.616 +42.227 D3 14:19:27 +52:40:56 096.227 +59.642 D4 22:15:31 -17:43:56 039.271 -52.925 -------------------------------------------------- This final release of the CFHTLS benefits greatly from vastly improved flat-fielding and photometric calibration techniques developed by the Supernovae Legacy Survey (SNLS) team and CFHT which allows us to significantly improve the precision of our photometric calibration compared to previous releases. The astrometric accuracy reaches 0.02arcsec internal and 0.2arcsec external.

@article{Newman2013b,
abstract = {We describe the design and data analysis of the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey, the densest and largest high-precision redshift survey of galaxies at z ∼ 1 completed to date. The survey was designed to conduct a comprehensive census of massive galaxies, their properties, environments, and large-scale structure down to absolute magnitude MB = -20 at z ∼ 1 via ∼90 nights of observation on the Keck telescope. The survey covers an area of 2.8 deg2 divided into four separate fields observed to a limiting apparent magnitude of RAB = 24.1. Objects with z ≲ 0.7 are readily identifiable using BRI photometry and rejected in three of the four DEEP2 fields, allowing galaxies with z {\textgreater} 0.7 to be targeted ∼2.5 times more efficiently than in a purely magnitude-limited sample. Approximately 60{\%} of eligible targets are chosen for spectroscopy, yielding nearly 53,000 spectra and more than 38,000 reliable redshift measurements. Most of the targets that fail to yield secure redshifts are blue objects that lie beyond z ∼ 1.45, where the [O II] 3727 {\AA} doublet lies in the infrared. The DEIMOS 1200 line mm-1 grating used for the survey delivers high spectral resolution (R ∼ 6000), accurate and secure redshifts, and unique internal kinematic information. Extensive ancillary data are available in the DEEP2 fields, particularly in the Extended Groth Strip, which has evolved into one of the richest multiwavelength regions on the sky. This paper is intended as a handbook for users of the DEEP2 Data Release 4, which includes all DEEP2 spectra and redshifts, as well as for the DEEP2 DEIMOS data reduction pipelines. Extensive details are provided on object selection, mask design, biases in target selection and redshift measurements, the spec2d two-dimensional data-reduction pipeline, the spec1d automated redshift pipeline, and the zspec visual redshift verification process, along with examples of instrumental signatures or other artifacts that in some cases remain after data reduction. Redshift errors and catastrophic failure rates are assessed through more than 2000 objects with duplicate observations. Sky subtraction is essentially photon-limited even under bright OH sky lines; we describe the strategies that permitted this, based on high image stability, accurate wavelength solutions, and powerful B-spline modeling methods. We also investigate the impact of targets that appear to be single objects in ground-based targeting imaging but prove to be composite in Hubble Space Telescope data; they constitute several percent of targets at z ∼ 1, approaching ∼5{\%}-10{\%} at z {\textgreater} 1.5. Summary data are given that demonstrate the superiority of DEEP2 over other deep high-precision redshift surveys at z ∼ 1 in terms of redshift accuracy, sample number density, and amount of spectral information. We also provide an overview of the scientific highlights of the DEEP2 survey thus far. {\textcopyright} 2013. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.},

@article{Benitez2000a,
abstract = {Photometric redshift estimation is becoming an increasingly important technique, although the currently existing methods present several shortcomings which hinder their application. Here it is shown that most of those drawbacks are efficiently eliminated when Bayesian probability is consistently applied to this problem. The use of prior probabilities and Bayesian marginalization allows the inclusion of valuable information, e.g. the redshift distributions or the galaxy type mix, which is often ignored by other methods. In those cases when the a priori information is insufficient, it is shown how to `calibrate' the prior distributions, using even the data under consideration. There is an excellent agreement between the 108 HDF spectroscopic redshifts and the predictions of the method, with a rms error Delta z/(1+z{\_}spec) = 0.08 up to z{\textless}6 and no systematic biases nor outliers. The reliability of the method is further tested by restricting the color information to the UBVI filters. The results thus obtained are shown to be more reliable than those of standard techniques even when the latter include near-IR colors. The Bayesian formalism developed here can be generalized to deal with a wide range of problems which make use of photometric redshifts. Several applications are outlined, e.g. the estimation of individual galaxy characteristics as the metallicity, dust content, etc., or the study of galaxy evolution and the cosmological parameters from large multicolor surveys. Finally, using Bayesian probability it is possible to develop an integrated statistical method for cluster mass reconstruction which simultaneously considers the information provided by gravitational lensing and photometric redshifts.},

abstract = {We present a novel approach to photometric redshifts, one that merges the advantages of both the template-Ðtting and empirical-Ðtting algorithms without any of their disadvantages. This technique derives a set of templates describing the spectral energy distributions of galaxies from a catalog with both multicolor photometry and spectroscopic redshifts. The algorithm is essentially using the shapes of the templates as the Ðtting parameters. From simulated multicolor data we show that for a small training set of galaxies we can reconstruct robustly the underlying spectral energy distributions even in the presence of substantial errors in the photometric observations. We apply these techniques to the multi-color and spectroscopic observations of the Hubble Deep Field, building a set of template spectra that reproduced the observed galaxy colors to better than 10{\%}. Finally, we demonstrate that these improved spectral energy distributions lead to a photometric redshift relation for the Hubble Deep Field that is more accurate than standard template-based approaches.},
