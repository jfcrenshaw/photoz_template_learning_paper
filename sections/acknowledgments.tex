This research is based on observations made with ESO Telescopes at the La Silla or Paranal Observatories under programme ID(s) 175.A-0839(B), 175.A-0839(D), 175.A-0839(I), 175.A-0839(J), 175.A-0839(H), 175.A-0839(F).
This research is also based on observations obtained with MegaPrime/MegaCam, a joint project of CFHT and CEA/DAPNIA, at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) which is operated by the National Research Council (NRC) of Canada, the Institut National des Science de l'Univers of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) of France, and the University of Hawaii.
This research is also based in part on data products produced at Terapix available at the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre as part of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey, a collaborative project of NRC and CNRS.
We use data from the VIMOS VLT Deep Survey, obtained from the VVDS database operated by Cesam, Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Marseille, France
We also use data from the VIMOS Public Extragalactic Redshift Survey (VIPERS).
VIPERS has been performed using the ESO Very Large Telescope, under the "Large Programme" 182.A-0886. 
The participating institutions and funding agencies are listed at http://vipers.inaf.it
